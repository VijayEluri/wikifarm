h2. Your account has admin powers.

* The "Manage" button next to each wiki in the "All Wikis" tab lets you invite/disinvite users/groups (same way regular users can do for wikis they own)

* "Wrench" icon next to each user on the "User List" tab lets you edit name/email/preferences/quota/groups

* "User List" tab shows unactivated users (regular users only see activated users)

* You get a "send me email about new accounts / group requests" checkbox on your "My Account" tab

* Your "Requests" tab shows any outstanding activation/group requests (along with any requests to read/edit your wikis)
