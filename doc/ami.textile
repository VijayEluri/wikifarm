h1. Using a pre-built AMI

Create an AWS instance using a pre-built wikifarm AMI (search for wikifarm, owner id 766185585730).

Point your browser to your new instance's public DNS name and log in with your OpenID.

Copy your OpenID URL from your "My Account" tab.

Log in to your new instance.

<pre>
ssh ubuntu@{your.instance.dns.name}
</pre>

Change your MySQL root password from "password" to something reasonable (details not covered here).

Update packages.

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
</pre>

Give your OpenID administrator privileges for the wikifarm.

* Visit @http://{your.wiki.farm}@
* Log in with your OpenID
* Copy your OpenID from the "my account" screen
* Run: @/etc/wikifarm/make_admin_user.php http://{your.openid.url}@

Configure your instance so it can send email notifications.

<pre>
sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
</pre>

Either relay all outgoing mail through a smarthost elsewhere, or attach an elastic IP address to your instance (details not covered here).  Otherwise, gmail.com (and others) will refuse mail from you.

Go back to your browser, fill in your user details on the "My Account" tab, and click "Save changes".  The "Admin Help" tab will appear, indicating that you have admin powers.

Now, go back to the "installation instructions":install.textile and continue from "turn off the deleteOnTermination attribute".
